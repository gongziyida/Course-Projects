# Computational Neuroscience and Neural Networks
They are codes for my computational neuroscience course. The neural networks in computational neuroscience are a little different, but also somewhat relavent, to those in deep learning. The essential differences are that the purpose here is to simulate nervous system, and that the focus is more on mathematics than algorhtm.
