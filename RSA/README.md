# RSA
The project is to implement big integer arithmetic and RSA, with the help of ```MessageDigest``` class. It is able to perform 
  * big integer addition, subtraction, multiplication, modular exponentiation, and extended Euclidean algorithm; 
  * RSA encryption, decryption, digital signature, and digital signature verification.
