# Project Description
This project is an implementation of a tree-based data structure where a ternary tree can be empty or a non-empty tree with three children that are either empty or a ternary tree.
# Acknowledgement
Supporting classes (mostly not uploaded) other than TernaryTree.java, TernaryNode.java, and TernaryTreeTestClient.java are provided by Dr. William C. Garrison III, my instructor of Data Structure.
